## learning strategies:
# 0: no prior information is given, the groupInfo is generated from learning stage, JADE is employed for search algorithm
# 1: given prior information, consider each of all the rest dimension as single groups
# 2: given prior information, consider all the rest dimensions as a whole, a large group
# 3: given prior information, consider uniformly randomly 
# 4: using uniform random walk for detecting interactions
# 5: using random sampling with binary search for detecting interactions
# 6: using uniform random sampling for detecting interactions
# 7: using uniform random sampling with generalized definition of interactions
# 8: using uniform random walk with generalized definition of interactions
# 9: using using binary search and random walk with generalized definition of interactions
