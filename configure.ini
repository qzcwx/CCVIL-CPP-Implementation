##learning strategies
# 0: no prior information is given, the groupInfo is generated from learning stage
# 1: given prior information, consider each of all the rest dimension as single groups
# 2: given prior information, consider all the rest dimensions as a whole, a large group
# 3: given prior information, consider uniformly randomly 
# 4: using uniform random walk for detecting interactions
# 5: using random sampling with binary search for detecting interactions
# 6: using uniform random sampling for detecting interactions
# 7: using uniform random sampling with generalized definition of interactions
